      <h5>Food Lifeline</h5>
        <p>Shoreline</p>
        <p>This orginization deals with food</p>
      <h6>I volunteer with my school once a month for an hour. Several high-schoolers join our group to get volunteer credit. Food lifeline is an organization that provides food taken out of supermarkets to food-banks. You know you're volunteering for a good cause, and helping the hungry members of Western-Washington. Bring a jacket, the warehouse can get cold!</h6>

      <h5>Friends of Northcreek Forest</h5>
        <p>Bothell</p>
        <p>This orginization deals with parks and recreation</p>
      <h6>Here, I helped restore a forest. The staff were very friendly, and a barbecue was prepared at the end of volunteering. Wear long pants, there are sharp plants. You will be working outdoors, so you will want to bring a coat.
